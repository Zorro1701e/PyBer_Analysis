PyBer Ride Share Analysis
Introduction:
Analyzing the data we were able to see large differences between the three different City types that are serviced by Pyber. Results of the analysis above indicate that the total fares for the Rural and Suburban markets are distinctly lower than in the Urban cities. There may be ways to market specifically to the lower earning markets. Here are my recommendations to increase revenue.
Recommendations:
- The cost of rides in the Suburban and Rural markets are much more expensive due to the longer   distances covered by these trips. In Rural areas offering discounts for trips over a certain distance may draw more customers. In Suburban areas however you may consider “frequent trip” incentives like “free miles”. This may be a better option in this market due to being more midrange in both drivers available as well as earnings.
- There is a lower number of drivers available in the two lower performing markets. Drawing new drivers is crucial to increasing revenue. More drivers will decrease wait time. Shorter wait time may draw more customers. Possibly a vehicle “lease to own” option may be a way to bring in new drivers. 
- The rides in the Urban markets are considerably shorter. A small increase in that market could help offset the lower prices in in Suburban and rural areas. 

Conclusion: Due to the earning differences between the three markets I recommend 3 things. Lower rates per mile for Rural areas while offering incentives to suburban markets. Hire more drivers and raise rates a small amount in urban areas.
